This is the second episode of my _7 languages in 7 weeks_ series of blog posts.
After ./2017-01-08-From-Java-to-Ruby.adoc[Ruby] a language which is more than 20 years old,
I tried Go the new kid on the block.

== The good

=== Simple to learn

Even if the language is pretty recent, there are many resources to learn Go.
The first one I stumbled upon was https://tour.golang.org/[Tour of Go],
it allows to discover the Go features and test them online.
You can run the web server locally if you want to learn Go in a train or in a plane.
It has been translated in many languages.

I also tried the https://github.com/cdarwin/go-koans[Go Koans],
but the tests are less detailed and progressive than Ruby Koans.
It took me an evening to complete these exercises.

Go is mostly simple to grasp because there are few concepts.
The Go Lang spec is less 100 pages long.

However the "Go" name is not SEO friendly, you'd better google "GoLang" instead.

=== Extensive tooling

As soon as you've installed Go and without extra steps, you can:

* *Get* libraries (Go packages) with a sort of package manager
* *Format* code to stick to Go formatting rules
* *Compile* code and link dependencies.
  Go doesn't allow dynamic linking.
  I was amazed to see how fast it was to compile a simple app and run it.
* *Run* unit tests.
  Go provides a unit testing package, sadly it's not has powerful as other XUnit libraries.
* *Analyze* code and detect suspicious constructs.
* *Search and Read* the base API documentation while being offline.



=== Switch, case, fallthrough

Compare Go's switch statement
[source,go]
----
include::{source_dir}/demo/switch.go[tags=main]
----
With Java's
[source,go]
----
include::{source_dir}/demo/Switch.java[tags=main]
----
The `fallthrough` keyword does the exact opposite of `break`.
This looks like a better default than Java to me,
because most of the time you don't want to run multiple cases.
A missing `break` can raise subtle bugs.

=== Concurrency with channels and routines



== The bad

=== Error handling

There has been debate about how errors are handled.
I hope not to start a troll with this paragraph.

In Go there is no Exception concept, you must use multiple return values:

[source,go]
----
include::{source_dir}/demo/error_handling.go[tags=main]
----
<1> Function can raise an error
<2> Raise an error
<3> Return normal result
<4> Propagate the error
<5> Handle normal flow
<6> Handle error flow

To me, this means multiple things

* In the function, I must always return 2 things: `nil+error` (1) or `result+nil` (2).
  I can even return both `result+error`.
* I need to manually propagate the error when it occurs (3).
  Yet the function signature warns me that I may have to do something, and I can't hardly forget it.
* Even if I forward the error, the error doesn't contain any call stack.
  As a result, it's probably harder to debug since you don't know who
  first returned the error (5).
  Hopefully the https://github.com/go-errors/error[go-errors] library may help.
* I can not easily chain function calls (4)
  because I can not write `Order(3).Print()` where `Print` is a function on the type `*Article`.
  I would have to create a function on the multiple type `*Article, error` but
  it's not possible.


=== Pointers

Pointers are not a bad thing per se.
But my C/C++ lectures are far away in my memory, it's not easy to remember the traps and tricks.
Should I pass this variable by reference or by value?

[source,go]
----
include::{source_dir}/demo/pointer.go[tags=main]
----
<1> Happily, I don't have to convert the pointer into value to access the `Price` field.
   I don't have to write `*a.Price` or `a->Price` like in C++
<2> The article price is still 25 because it was passed by value
<3> Here I have to convert the value into a pointer
<4> The article price is now 27 because it was passed by reference

=== `make`, `new` and `New`

To create, I mean allocate, something there are several operators depending on the type
and whether you are expecting a pointer or not.
[source,go]
----
include::{source_dir}/demo/make_new.go[tags=main]
----
<1> Create a new struct and initialize its fields
<2> Create a new struct and return a pointer
<3> Create a new array and initialize its elements
<4> Create a new array and return an pointer
<5> Create a new slice
<6> Create a new map and initialize its elements
<7> Create a new map
<8> Create a new struct `Error` and initialize it

The `new` operator always return a pointer, it's like a `malloc` operator in C.
The `make` operator is used to create data structures like slices, maps...
Neither the `new` nor the `make` operators can be passed values,
they are initialized with zeros and empty strings.
The `New` function can contain code to initialize or build something.

I find it a bit disturbing to have different syntaxes to do mostly the same thing.

=== Unused

The Go compiler is very strict, this can be good thing at times as it may prevent bugs.
But it can be bit too picky and annoying at times.
In particular, it doesn't accept unused variables and unused imports.
This is a rather common scenario when you are refactoring or trying something.

Yet I didn't use an IDE (like Jetbrains Gogland) with an intelligent coding assistant
which would fix imports for me.

== The odd

Characters are called *Runes* in the Go terminology.
But they don't hide any secret magic ;-) .

=== Declare in `if`

The `for` statement uses the usual syntax minus the parenthesis:
[source,go]
----
include::{source_dir}/demo/decl_if.go[tags=for]
----

Like in the above `for` construct, the `if` can declare a variable before the mandatory condition:
[source,go]
----
include::{source_dir}/demo/decl_if.go[tags=main]
----
<1> The `dice` variable is visible in the while `if`/`else` bloc.

In the above example, I find the `if` statement to be less readable because
the eye has to remove the `dice` declaration noise.

=== The `:=` symbol

The `:=` symbol is called _short variable declaration_,
it triggers type inference so you don't have to declare the type of your local variable.
[source,go]
----
var i int = 12
i := 12
----
Both variable declaration are the same.

I just wonder why there is a special symbol for that.
At first, I thought it was to tell apart assignment from comparison (`==`) like in Pascal.

=== Packages and imports

I wonder why imported packages are strings wrapped by double quotes:
[source,go]
----
import "fmt"
----

Then, when there are subpackages, only the last part of the package is used in the code:
[source,go]
----
include::{source_dir}/demo/subpackage.go[tags=main]
----
<1> Notice that the imported package is named `io/ioutil` not `io/util`.
<2> To use a function in this package, I use `ioutil.Readfile` not `io/ioutil.Readfile`.

Naming a package `util`( or `common` or ...) in Go is a poor idea, for instance `string/util` is conflicting with `date/util`.
Unless you give an alias to the import, but it looks less convenient:
[source,go]
----
import stringutil "string/util"
----
