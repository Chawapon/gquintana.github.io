# 7Li7W: Ruby

:hp-tags: 7li7w, ruby

One of my 2017 resolutions is to try different languages and see how they compare to Java.
This is inspired by the https://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks[7 languages in 7 weeks] book by Bruce A. Tate.

The first language I've tried is Ruby.
Ruby was created by Yukihiro Matsumoto in the nineties (like Java).
I mostly heard of it through the Ruby on Rails web framework.
I used the http://rubykoans.com/[Ruby Koans] to teach myself Ruby.

## The good

[source,ruby]
----
a=["one","two","three","four"]
puts a[1..-2]
# => two three
first, *tail = a
----

## The bad


## Everything else

Objects have a numeric Id which can be used for reference comparison

[source,ruby]
----
o=Object.new
put o.object_id
# => 4376500
----
