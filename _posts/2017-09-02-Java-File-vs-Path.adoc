= Java File vs Path

I've been using `java.io.File` and `java.io.File*Stream` since Java 1.1 a long time ago.
Java 7 introduced a new file API with `java.nio.file.Path` and `java.nio.file.Files`.

== Quick comparison


== Multiple file systems

When the `File` is only for local files, `Path` can be used to access remote files.
A `Path` is associated to `FileSystem`. 
To create a new `Path` instances, the above 2 lines are the same:

```
path = Paths.get("path/to/file.txt");
path = FileSystems.getDefault().getPath("path/to/file.txt");
```
As the default file system is the local one, you get a path to local file.

But you can plug additional file systems: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/io/fsp/zipfilesystemprovider.html[ZIP], https://github.com/maddingo/nio-fs-provider[SFTP, SMB, WebDAV], https://github.com/lucastheisen/jsch-nio[SSH/SCP], https://github.com/Upplication/Amazon-S3-FileSystem-NIO2[Amazon S3], https://github.com/google/jimfs[In memory], https://github.com/damiencarol/jsr203-hadoop[HDFS], ...
It means you can read a remote file as if it were local
