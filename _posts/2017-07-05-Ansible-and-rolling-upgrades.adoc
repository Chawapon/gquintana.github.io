# Ansible and rolling upgrades

Ansible is a nice tool to deploy software associated configuration for distributed systems like Elasticsearch, Kafka, Cassandra and the like.
These distributed systems are built to avoid downtime and allow partial failures.
Upgrading these softwares or updating their configuration requires restarting each member of the cluster.
